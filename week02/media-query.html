            <h2>Alma 37:37</h2>
            <p>Counsel with the Lord in all thy doings, and he will direct thee for good; yea, when thou liest down at
                night lie down unto the Lord, that he may watch over you in your sleep; and when thou risest in the
                morning let thy heart be full of thanks unto God; and if ye do these things, ye shall be lifted up at
                the last day.</p>

            <h2>Moroni 7:48</h2>
            <p>Wherefore, my beloved brethren, pray unto the Father with all the energy of heart, that ye may be filled
                with this love, which he hath bestowed upon all who are true followers of his Son, Jesus Christ; that ye
                may become the sons of God; that when he shall appear we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he
                is; that we may have this hope; that we may be purified even as he is pure. Amen.</p>
